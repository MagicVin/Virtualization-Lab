## Linux Virtualization
Virtualization is a concept that creates virtualized resources and maps them to physical resources.

## Type of virtualization

### **Five different types of virtualization**
1. #### Desktop virtualization
	> It is technology that lets users simulate a workstation load to access a desktop from a connected device.  [[Citrix]](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/vdi-and-daas/what-is-desktop-virtualization.html) 
	
	| The types of Desktop Virtualization|
	----------------------------------------------
	| * Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)  |
	| * Remote desktop services (RDS)         |
	| * Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS)              |
	
 2. #### Server virtualization
    > It is the process of dividing a physical server into multiple unique and isolated virtual servers by means of a software application. Each virtual server can run its own operating systems independently. [[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/server-virtualization.html)]
   
	  |The types of Server virtualization	|
	  ----------------------------------------
	  | * Full Virtualization                           |
	   | * Para-Virtualization                     |
	  | * OS-Level Virtualization              |

3. #### Application virtualization
