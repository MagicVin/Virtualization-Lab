## Linux Virtualization
Virtualization is a concept that creates virtualized resources and maps them to physical resources.

## Type of virtualization

### **Five different types of virtualization**
1. #### Desktop virtualization
	> It is technology that lets users simulate a workstation load to access a desktop from a connected device.  [[Citrix]](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/vdi-and-daas/what-is-desktop-virtualization.html) 
	
	**The types of Desktop Virtualization**
	* Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)  
	* Remote desktop services (RDS)         
	* Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS)            
	
 2. #### Server virtualization
    > It is the process of dividing a physical server into multiple unique and isolated virtual servers by means of a software application. Each virtual server can run its own operating systems independently. [[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/server-virtualization.html)]
   
	**The types of Server virtualization**
	* Full Virtualization        
	* Para-Virtualization     
	* OS-Level Virtualization        

3. #### Application virtualization
   > It is technology that allows users to access and use an application from a separate computer than the one on which the application is installed. [[Citrix]](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/vdi-and-daas/what-is-application-virtualization.html)
4. #### Network virtualization
   > It is the transformation of a network that was once hardware-dependent into a network that is software-based. Like all forms of IT virtualization, the basic goal of network virtualization is to introduce a layer of abstraction between physical hardware and the activities that utilize that hardware.
